\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This dissertation is concerned with fair, efficient and safe sharing of
domain specific accelerators between mutually distrustful users.

Domain Specific Accelerators (DSAs) are programmable compute units that are
specialized to a particular class of computation in order to improve
performance, or to optimize energy usage (or both) for that class of
computation. DSAs are seeing wide adoption in  data centers as they afford
the data center provider very high performance per dollar on the class of
computation they are specialized for. For example, a 2013 projection by Google
showed that they would need to double the installed CPU compute capacity in
in order to support just three minutes of Google Voice Search per user per
day, using speech recognition DNNs~\cite{TPU-CACM}.
This realization led Google to design and adopt the Tensorflow Processing
Unit (TPU), a DSA specialized for the Tensor-based computation popular in
Neural Networks. The very first generation of TPUs, which were deployed to
Google data centers in 2015, were empirically found to have 200$\times$ and
79$\times$ higher Performance/Watt respectively over the CPUs and Nvidia k80
GPUs that were prevalent in their data centers at the time~\cite{TPU-ISCA}.

Data centers themselves are proliferating rapidly: a recent report by
Synergy Research~\cite{datacentergrowth-src} found that there were more than
500 hyperscale data centers operational across the world at the end of 2019.
This proliferation of data centers is primarily motivated by the increased
need for computation resulting from the unquestionable permeation of digital
services into every facet of our lives (e.g., Google Maps, video streaming,
digital communication). Data centers leverage the cost efficiency of
centralized computing, while using techniques such as virtualization to
provide the flexibility of dedicated/distributed computing.

Virtualization is a cornerstone technology in our current computing landscape.
Unlike physical compute, virtualized compute resources can be securely
multiplexed among many users, which allows for high utilization of the
installed compute capacity. Further, virtualization provides customers with
the ability to scale elastically: when the demand for a digital service is
high, the customer may request and utilize a large number of machines; when
the spike in demand subsides, the customer can just release the excess compute
resources, thereby only paying for what they are actively using.

Virtualization of domain specific accelerators remains an open problem:
DSAs are dedicated to single users instead of being multiplexed in today's
data centers. Cloud providers such as Amazon expose Graphical Processing Units
(GPU) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to individual VMs via
PCIe-passthrough, thereby bypassing the hypervisor, and giving up the
consolidation and fault tolerance benefits of virtualization.
This dissertation explores the trade-offs in the design space for
software-based virtualization schemes for DSAs and proposes a low-overhead
novel virtualization scheme that interposes the user-facing Application
Programmer's Interface (API) while using automation to compensate for the
resulting development complexity.

\section{History of Virtualization}
The story of virtualization is long and tumultuous, stretching from the very
early days of computing, right to today.
Memory was the first resource to be virtualized:
German physicist Fritz-Rudolf GÃ¼ntsch described the basic idea of
virtual memory in his doctoral dissertation in 1956~\cite{virtual-memory}.
The Cambridge University/Ferranti Inc. Atlas~\cite{atlas-vm} computer was the
first to openly commercialize virtual memory. Virtually all computers since
then have supported virtual memory, with most providing hardware units---\emph{
Memory Management Unit (MMU)}---to accelerate the virtualization of memory.

The next era dealt with the virtualization of the individual machine with it's
processor and peripherals.
\emph{Hardware virtualization}~\cite{cp40}---the idea of virtualizing the
entire computer to enable the simultaneous execution of multiple Operating
Systems (OS)---was invented in 1962, and commercialized in the IBM
VM-370~\cite{vm370} hypervisor for the IBM 370 computer.
Virtualization was briefly forgotten through the 1980s and 1990s, as the
mainframe computer became all but obsolete during the Personal Computer (PC)
revolution. Intel's x86 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), which came to
dominate the PCs that transplanted the mainframes, was not designed to be
traditionally virtualizable~\cite{popek-goldberg}, and was widely considered
unvirtualizable~\cite{gelsinger-pc,bugnion-workstation}. Multiple vendors
introduced \emph{software emulation} based solutions to enable the execution
of one OS on top of another (e.g., Insignia SoftPC, Connectix VirtualPC,
VMware Workstation). Over time, better techniques were devised to virtualize
the x86 ISA, including ISA extensions (e.g., AMD-V and Intel VT-x) to enable
native execution of virtualized applications, only trapping to the hypervisor
when the application attempts to perform sensitive operations.

Hardware interfaces weren't the only ones virtualized, and in fact, most
computing environments today rely on hardware virtualization and one or more
of the following \emph{software virtualization} schemes working in tandem.
Sun Microsystems popularized \emph{application virtualization} in the 1990s
with the Java programming language: applications are written to an abstract
machine---the \emph{Java Virtual Machine (JVM)}---which is backed by a runtime
system that ensures the program can execute on any platform.
This scheme eschews \emph{compatibility}---the ability to execute unmodified
legacy applications---for \emph{portability}.
\emph{Operating system-level virtualization} (e.g., Library OSes, Containers)
virtualizes yet another layer in the software stack: the operating system's
interfaces (e.g., system calls, kernel name-spaces). This style of
virtualization preserves compatibility by transparently modifying the
interfaces the application uses to access system resources, and results in
low overhead execution.

\section{Hardware Virtualization}
This dissertation is primarily concerned with hardware virtualization of
domain specific accelerators. Hardware virtualization is vital to high
utilization of available physical resources in large computing installations,
e.g., hardware virtualization is foundational to \textit{cloud computing}.
There have been many attempts to define the fundamental characteristics of
hardware virtualization: Popek and Goldberg came up with three properties that
a virtualization scheme must exhibit---\emph{equivalence, performance, and
safety}, while Bugnion, Nieh and Tsafrir~\cite{ bugnion-nieh-tsafrir} provided
a more succinct definition---\textit{``the application of the layering
principle with enforced modularity such that the exposed resource is identical
to the underlying resource''}. For the purposes of this dissertation, we
concern ourselves with \emph{realizable, fair, isolated, and efficient sharing
of domain specific accelerators among mutually distrustful entities.}

Hardware virtualization typically involves mediating access to the shared
resource either by exposing an interface that is identical to that of the
physical resource (\emph{full-virtualization}), or by exposing an alternative
interface, operations on which are in-turn synthesized to the native interface
(\emph{para-virtualization}).
The exposed interface is considered \emph{virtual}, as it is not controlled by
the physical underlying hardware, and instead is entirely under the control of
supervisory virtualization software, the \emph{hypervisor} (also known as the
\emph{Virtual Machine Monitor}). While operations in the resulting \emph{
virtual machine} may be directly executed on the physical hardware for
improved performance, as in the case of hardware-assisted virtualization
schemes like AMD-V and Intel VT-x, all privileged operations must still trap
to the hypervisor.
% The interface interposed may be a hardware interface (ISA,
% Memory, I/O Protocols, etc.) or a software interface (Syscalls, APIs, etc.).

Four decades of attention from both the academic community and industry has
given rise to a large body of techniques that enable efficient virtualization
of CPUs. Software techniques, such as binary translation and device emulation,
are well established, and are still used in practice due to lower overhead for
sequences of sensitive instructions that need to be emulated~\cite{
vmware-esx-bt-plus-vtx}. Dominant ISAs (e.g., x86 and ARM) provide extensions
to enable low-overhead virtualization (e.g.,Intel VT-x, AMD-V). Both of these
are foundational building blocks for cloud computing~\cite{amazon_ec2}.

\section{Virtualizing Domain Specific Accelerators}
Virtualizing Domain Specific Accelerators is a delicate act of balancing the
essential characteristics of a virtualization scheme---compatibility,
interposition, sharing, isolation---with the need to preserve the raw
performance these processors provide.
Virtualization techniques developed for CPUs (ISA virtualization) can not be
applied to these accelerators: their control interfaces are closer to those of
I/O devices than the ISAs of CPUs. Techniques developed for I/O devices, such
as NICs, are also untenable for DSAs as they sacrifice of one or more
essential virtualization characteristics.
Full-virtualization based schemes (e.g.,GPUvm~\cite{suzuki2014gpuvm}) suffer
from massive overheads that essentially negate the speedup that makes the
domain specific accelerator attractive in the first place.
Para-virtual systems that interpose on low-level interfaces such as the kernel
driver (e.g., SVGA~\cite{dowty2009gpu}), introduce much lower overhead than
full-virtualization based schemes but have poor compatibility. The
introduction of an artificial abstract interface constructed expressly for the
purpose of interposition necessitates massive engineering effort to support
new hardware in the host and new software frameworks in the guest.
User-space API-remoting solutions~\cite{vmCUDA,rCUDA,rCUDAnew} interpose on
the user-space API in the guest and forward the interposed operation to the
host as an RPC. This approach introduces very low overhead and can evolve with
the hardware easily, but has traditionally eschewed hypervisor interposition,
thereby making it difficult to enforce safety and isolation among guests.

Virtualizing a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for the purposes of graphics
rendering is a well studied problem, with existing commercial solutions (e.g.,
VMwareâs SVGA~\cite{dowty2009gpu}). Over the last decade, GPUs have also been
re-purposed for general purpose compute (commonly known as GPGPU).
Chapter 2 of this dissertation presents background on domain specific
accelerators, how their software stacks are different from those of CPUs and
I/O devices, and how and why previous software virtualization solutions do not
fare well for DSAs. In order to understand the trade-offs with each of the
canonical virtualization techniques when applied to GPGPU virtualization, we
present an end-to-end evaluation of representative systems. Chapter 2 also
considers the notion of the modern DSA stack being a proprietary silo, i.e.,
that it's only stable and publicly available interfaces are at the top and the
bottom. Later chapters build on this notion of silo-ed DSA software stacks to
design an effective virtualization scheme.

GPGPUs embody the hardware interface and software stack design that are
commonly used when building DSAs, and are at the most widely adopted DSA.
GPGPU virtualization has concretely been studied for the last decade, and yet
a viable virtualization technique has not emerged. While the drawbacks of
these previously considered virtualization techniques are presented in Chapter
2~\ref{chapter:background}, Chapter 3~\ref{chapter:trillium} presents
empirical analysis of representatives of each of the canonical techniques
previously considered. Chapter 3 also contains the findings from our attempt
to extend VMware's SVGA model of GPU virtualization to virtualize GPGPUs. We
prototyped this extension of the SVGA design for the Xen Hypervisor (as that
was the common platform that the rest of the systems evaluated ran on), and
hence call this prototype \XenSVGA. Briefly, we find that while SVGA
worked really well for graphical rendering workloads, a naive extension of the
same model performs poorly for GPU compute workloads. There are two sources of
inefficiencies in this design. This chapter highlights the first: the tight
coupling between ISA virtualization and device virtualization.

Eliding ISA virtualization in the \XenSVGA design, enables the
resulting prototype, \Trillium~\cite{trillium}, to outperform all
other traditional virtualization schemes that retain hypervisor interposition.
However, \Trillium remains 2---3$\times$ slower than user-space API
remoting. This overhead was found to result from our choice of interposition
point in \Trillium: our implementation of \Trillium interposed the
``pipe-driver'', the interface between the front and back ends of the GNU/
Linux graphics driver system. Interposing this interface meant that a single
user-space API call made by the compute application in the VM resulted in
multiple interposition events, each of which contributed a fixed remoting
overhead. On the other hand, only one such interposition event (with no
hypervisor involvement) occurs in a user-space API remoting, leading to the
vastly lower overhead observed.

Our desire to find a virtualization design that involved hypervisor based
interposition at an upper layer in the software stack, preferably of the
user-space API exposed by the DSA led to a alternative analysis framework
called \iemts (presented in Chapter 4~\ref{chapter:iemts}) that teases
apart design axes that are implicitly and unnecessarily intertwined in much of
the literature. Analyzing a virtualization design using \iemts
involves focusing on the \textbf{I}nterface the design interposes, the
interposition \textbf{E}ndpoints, the \textbf{M}echanism of interposition, the
\textbf{T}ransport used to move the interposed operations between the guest
and the host, and the mechanism used to \textbf{S}ynthesize the interposed
interface. We argue that \iemts enables a clearer understanding of
trade-offs in prior designs and provides a model for comparison of alternative
designs.

Domain Specific Accelerators (e.g., Google TPU, Intel QAT, etc.) are
typically exposed to developers via a user-space API. The API is typically
implemented by proprietary software that interacts with the hardware through
opaque interfaces.
Chapters 5 and 6 generalize the lessons learned for GPGPUs to all
API-controlled domain specific accelerators by interposing user-space APIs.
Chapter 5 presents an overview of AvA, a framework that enables automated
virtualization of accelerator APIs. AvA combines on a novel virtualization
scheme called Hypervisor Interposed Remote Acceleration (HIRA), with
automation based on a Domain Specific Language, LAPIS, which is used to
capture semantic information of the interposed APIs. This dissertation is
primarily concerned with the HIRA virtualization scheme.
Chapters 5 draw on material that appeared in a HotOS workshop
paper~\cite{ava-hotos} and an ASPLOS'20 paper~\cite{ava-asplos}.
While chapter 5 focuses on the performance implications of API-remoting based
virtualization of a single specialized accelerator, Chapter 6 explores
performance issues that arise when an application uses multiple API-remoted
virtual accelerators in a pipelined fashion.
