\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concluion}
Virtualization techniques that rely on clean separation of software layers are
untenable for accelerator \emph{silos}.
\AvA is an alternative approach that interposes compute-offload APIs,
uses automation to provide agility, recover hypervisor
interposition, and shorten development cycles.
