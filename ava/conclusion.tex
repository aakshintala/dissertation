\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concluion}
The \emph{silo}-ed nature of DSA software stacks means that the user-space API
is the only viable interface for a virtualization scheme to interpose. While
most prior work that interposes this interface have been user-space only,
i.e., they elide all hypervisor involvement, analysis of prior techniques
using the \iemts framework showed that it is possible to build a
virtualization scheme that interposes the user-space API but maintains
hypervisor involvement by utilizing a hypervisor-mediated transport. \hirafull
enables the hypervisor to enforce fairness guarantees and perform resource
control, while introducing low overhead on the virtualized workload.
\AvA, our implementation of the \hira technique, represents a viable DSA
virtualization approach that interposes compute-offload APIs, uses automation
to provide agility, retains hypervisor interposition, and shortens development
cycles.
