CPU virtualization as a technique was first considered for the IBM 360 in 1970~
\cite{meyer-virtual-machines}. The idea then, as it is today is, was to provide
each user with the illusion of having a dedicated machine to themselves, by
simultaneously running multiple operating systems on the same machine.
The IBM~370 was specifically designed to be
\emph{virtualizable}~\cite{popek-goldberg}.

The PC revolution, in the 1980s, saw new ISAs establish their dominance in
computing. These new ISAs were not explicitly designed to be virtualizable; on
the contrary, Intel x86 is considered classically unvirtualizable. Intel's CTO at the time, Pat Gelsinger is
