Virtualization has such a long and storied history that Attempting to capture
the entire story is an exercise in futility. The introduction~\ref{sec:intro}
captures the history of CPU virtualization in broad strokes. This section then
focuses on a major theme of the proposed dissertation:
accelerator virtualization.

Accelerating specific computation is not a new idea---support for specialized
computation is extremely commonplace in CPUs (e.g., Floating Point Units
(FPU), Vector Processing Units). These specialized compute units are
typically exposed to the programmer as extensions to the Instruction Set
Architecture (ISA). Virtualizing these specialized compute units, therefore,
is no different from virtualizing the rest of the CPU and ISA virtulaization
is well explored~\cite{cp40,vm370,popek-goldberg,bugnion-disco,
bugnion-nieh-tsafrir,bugnion-workstation}.

Processors specialized for complex computational tasks, such as graphical
rendering, largely evolved as discrete devices separate from the CPU (although
some CPUs do integrate GPUs). These devices are not typically integrated into
the CPU ISA; instead, they appear to system software as I/O devices with
memory-mapped command-queues and I/O registers. I/O virtualization is well
understood~\cite{waldspurger12cacm,paradice,Kuperman_undated-io,Sig2010-ml,
zeng2013improved,abramson2006intel}, but
