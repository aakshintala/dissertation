# Amogh's dissertation.

This dissertation deals with software techniques for the virtualization of compute accelerators.
Briefly, we find that hypervisor-mediated API-remoting is the only viable technique for discrete API-controlled accelerators.

The dissertation itself is empty for now.
Check out the [proposal](https://github.com/aakshintala/dissertation/blob/master/proposal/proposal.pdf) (also currently WIP).
