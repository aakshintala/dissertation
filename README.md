## Toward Efficient and Realizable Hardware Virtualization

This dissertation deals with software techniques for the virtualization of compute accelerators.
Briefly, we find that hypervisor-mediated API-remoting is the only viable technique for discrete API-controlled accelerators.

The dissertation itself is empty for now.
