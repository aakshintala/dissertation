@Inproceedings {ptask,
abstract     = {<p>We propose a new set of OS abstractions to support GPUs and other accelerator
                devices as first class computing resources. These new abstractions, collectively
                called the PTask API, support a dataflow programming model. Because a PTask graph
                consists of OS-managed objects, the kernel has sufficient visibility and control
                to provide system-wide guarantees like fairness and performance isolation, and
                can streamline data movement in ways that are impossible under current GPU
                programming models.</p>

                <p>Our experience developing the PTask API, along with a gestural interface on
                Windows 7 and a FUSE-based encrypted file system on Linux show that the PTask API
                can provide important systemwide guarantees where there were previously none, and
                can enable significant performance improvements, for example gaining a
                5{\times}improvement in maximum throughput for the gestural interface.</p>},

@Inproceedings {dandelion,
abstract     = {<p>Computer systems increasingly rely on heterogeneity to achieve greater
                performance, scalability and energy efficiency. Because heterogeneous systems
                typically comprise multiple execution contexts with different programming
                abstractions and runtimes, programming them remains extremely challenging.
                Dandelion is a system designed to address this programmability challenge for
                data-parallel applications. Dandelion provides a unified programming model for
                heterogeneous systems that span diverse execution contexts including CPUs, GPUs,
                FPGAs, and the cloud. It adopts the .NET LINQ (Language INtegrated Query)
                approach, integrating data-parallel operators into general purpose programming
                languages such as C{\#} and F{\#}. It therefore provides an expressive data model and
                native language integration for user-defined functions, enabling programmers to
                write applications using standard high-level languages and development tools.</p>

                <p>Dandelion automatically and transparently distributes data-parallel portions
                of a program to available computing resources, including compute clusters for
                distributed execution and CPU and GPU cores of individual nodes for parallel
                execution. To enable automatic execution of .NET code on GPUs, Dandelion
                cross-compiles .NET code to CUDA kernels and uses the PTask runtime to manage GPU
                execution. This paper discusses the design and implementation of Dandelion,
                focusing on the distributed CPU and GPU implementation. We evaluate the system
                using a diverse set of workloads.</p>},

               integration among devices, with emerging features such as shared
               virtual memory, memory coherence, and systemwide atomics.
               Languages, device architectures, system specifications, and
               applications are rapidly adapting to the challenges and
               opportunities of tightly integrated heterogeneous platforms.
               Programming languages such as OpenCL 2.0, CUDA 8.0, and C++ AMP
               allow programmers to exploit these architectures for productive
               collaboration between CPU and GPU threads. To evaluate these new
               architectures and programming languages, and to empower
               researchers to experiment with new ideas, a suite of benchmarks
               targeting these architectures with close CPU-GPU collaboration
               is needed. In this paper, we classify applications that target
               heterogeneous architectures into generic collaboration patterns
               including data partitioning, fine-grain task partitioning, and
               coarse-grain task partitioning. We present Chai, a new suite of
               14 benchmarks that cover these patterns and exercise different
               features of heterogeneous architectures with varying intensity.
               Each benchmark in Chai has seven different implementations in
               different programming models such as OpenCL, C++ AMP, and CUDA,
               and with and without the use of the latest heterogeneous
               architecture features. We characterize the behavior of each
               benchmark with respect to varying input sizes and collaboration
               combinations, and evaluate the impact of using the emerging
               features of heterogeneous architectures on application
               performance.",

               computing systems allows programs to achieve high performance
               and energy efficiency, but results in substantial software
               re-development cost for each type or generation of hardware. To
               mitigate this cost, a performance portable programming system is
               required. One fundamental difference between architectures that
               makes performance portability challenging is the hierarchical
               organization of their computing elements. To address this
               challenge, we introduce TANGRAM, a kernel synthesis framework
               that composes architecture-neutral computations and composition
               rules into high-performance kernels customized for different
               architectural hierarchies. TANGRAM is based on an extensible
               architectural model that can be used to specify a variety of
               architectures. This model is coupled with a generic design space
               exploration and composition algorithm that can generate multiple
               composition plans for any specified architecture. A custom code
               generator then compiles these plans for the target architecture
               while performing various optimizations such as data placement
               and tuning. We show that code synthesized by TANGRAM for
               different types and generations of devices achieves no less than
               70\% of the performance of highly optimized vendor libraries
               such as Intel MKL and NVIDIA CUBLAS/CUSPARSE.",

  abstract  = "Technology scaling and growing use of accelerators make
               optimization of data movement of increasing importance in all
               computing systems. Further, growing diversity in memory
               structures makes embedding such optimization in software
               non-portable. We propose a novel architectural solution called
               Data Layout Transformation (DLT) associated with a simple set of
               instructions that enable software to describe the required data
               movement compactly, and free the implementation to optimize the
               movement based on the knowledge of the memory hierarchy and
               system structure. The DLT architecture ideas can be applicable
               to both general-purpose and accelerator-based heterogeneous
               systems. Experiment results first show that the proposed DLT
               architecture can make use of the full bandwidth (>97\%) of a
               wide range of memory systems (DDR3 and HMC) while its
               implementation cost is relatively low, occupying only 0.24 mm2
               and consuming 75mW at 1GHz in 32nm CMOS technology. Our
               evaluation of using the DLT accelerator in accelerated-based
               heterogeneous system across DDR3 and HMC memory shows that the
               DLT can enhance system performance in range of 4.6x-99x (DDR3),
               4.4x-115x (HMC) which turns out 2.8x-48x (DDR3), 1.4x-39x (HMC)

               by graphics processing units (GPUs) remains a challenging
               problem. Data communication in popular parallel programming
               models, such as the Message Passing Interface (MPI), is
               currently limited to the data stored in the CPU memory space.
               Auxiliary memory systems, such as GPU memory, are not integrated
               into such data movement frameworks, thus providing applications
               with no direct mechanism to perform end-to-end data movement. We
               introduce MPI-ACC, an integrated and extensible framework that
               allows end-to-end data movement in accelerator-based systems.
               MPI-ACC provides productivity and performance benefits by
               integrating support for auxiliary memory spaces into MPI.
               MPI-ACC's runtime system enables several key optimizations,
               including pipelining of data transfers and balancing of
               communication based on accelerator and node architecture. We
               demonstrate the extensible design of MPIACC by using the popular
               CUDA and OpenCL accelerator programming interfaces. We examine
               the impact of MPI-ACC on communication performance and evaluate

               processing on current Solid-State Disk (SSD) architectures.
               While disk-based in-storage processing has not been widely
               adopted, due to the characteristics of hard disks, modern SSDs
               provide high performance on concurrent random writes, and have
               powerful processors, memory, and multiple I/O channels to flash
               memory, enabling in-storage processing with almost no hardware
               changes. In addition, offloading I/O tasks allows a host system
               to fully utilize devices' internal parallelism without knowing
               the details of their hardware configurations. To leverage the
               enhanced data processing capabilities of modern SSDs, we
               introduce the Smart SSD model, which pairs in-device processing
               with a powerful host system capable of handling data-oriented
               tasks without modifying operating system code. By isolating the
               data traffic within the device, this model promises low energy
               consumption, high parallelism, low host memory footprint and
               better performance. To demonstrate these capabilities, we
               constructed a prototype implementing this model on a real
               SATA-based SSD. Our system uses an object-based protocol for
               low-level communication with the host, and extends the Hadoop
               MapReduce framework to support a Smart SSD. Our experiments show
               that total energy consumption is reduced by 50\% due to the
               low-power processing inside a Smart SSD. Moreover, a system with
               a Smart SSD can outperform host-side processing by a factor of
               two or three by efficiently utilizing internal parallelism when
               applications have light trafic to the device DRAM under the
               current architecture.",

  abstract  = "PythonTeX is a LaTeX package that allows Python code in LaTeX
               documents to be executed and provides access to the output. This
               makes possible reproducible documents that combine results with
               the code required to generate them. Calculations and figures may
               be next to the code that created them. Since code is adjacent to
               its output in the document, editing may be more efficient. Since
               code output may be accessed programmatically in the document,
               copy-and-paste errors are avoided and output is always
               guaranteed to be in sync with the code that generated it. This
               paper provides an introduction to PythonTeX and an overview of
               major features, including performance optimizations, debugging
               tools, and dependency tracking. Several complete examples are
               presented. Finally, advanced features are summarized. Though
               PythonTeX was designed for Python, it may be extended to support
               additional languages; support for the Ruby and Julia languages
               is already included. PythonTeX contains a utility for converting

               multi-core architectures as a mechanism to reduce processor
               power dissipation. Our design incorporates heterogeneous cores
               representing different points in the power/performance design
               space; during an application's execution, system software
               dynamically chooses the most appropriate core to meet specific
               performance and power requirements. Our evaluation of this
               architecture shows significant energy benefits. For an objective
               function that optimizes for energy efficiency with a tight
               performance threshold, for 14 SPEC benchmarks, our results
               indicate a 39\% average energy reduction while only sacrificing
               3\% in performance. An objective function that optimizes for
               energy-delay with looser performance bounds achieves, on
               average, nearly a factor of three improvements in energy-delay
               product while sacrificing only 22\% in performance. Energy
               savings are substantially more than chip-wide voltage/frequency
               scaling.",

  abstract  = "General purpose GPU Computing (GPGPU) has taken off in the past
               few years, with great promises for increased desktop processing
               power due to the large number of fast computing cores on
               high-end graphics cards. Many publications have demonstrated
               phenomenal performance and have reported speedups as much as
               1000$\times$ over code running on multi-core CPUs. Other studies
               have claimed that well-tuned CPU code reduces the performance
               gap significantly. We demonstrate that this important discussion
               is missing a key aspect, specifically the question of where in
               the system data resides, and the overhead to move the data to
               where it will be used, and back again if necessary. We have
               benchmarked a broad set of GPU kernels on a number of platforms
               with different GPUs and our results show that when memory
               transfer times are included, it can easily take between 2 to
               50$\times$ longer to run a kernel than the GPU processing time
               alone. Therefore, it is necessary to either include memory
               transfer overhead when reporting GPU performance, or to explain
               why this is not relevant for the application in question. We
               suggest a taxonomy for future CPU/GPU comparisons, and we argue
               that this is not only germane for reporting performance, but is
               important to heterogeneous scheduling research in general.",

                can become a surprisingly important bottleneck-in our test, a
                set of general-purpose, highly parallelized applications spends
                64\% of total execution time deserializing data into objects.
                This paper presents the Morpheus model, which allows
                applications to move such computations to a storage device. We
                use this model to deserialize data into application objects
                inside storage devices, rather than in the host CPU. Using the
                Morpheus model for object deserialization avoids unnecessary
                system overheads, frees up scarce CPU and main memory resources
                for compute-intensive workloads, saves I/O bandwidth, and
                reduces power consumption. In heterogeneous,
                co-processor-equipped systems, Morpheus allows application
                objects to be sent directly from a storage device to a
                coprocessor (e.g., a GPU) by peer-to-peer transfer, further
                improving application performance as well as reducing the CPU
                and main memory utilizations. This paper implements
                Morpheus-SSD, an SSD supporting the Morpheus model.
                Morpheus-SSD improves the performance of object deserialization
                by 1.66$\times$, reduces power consumption by 7\%, uses 42\%
                less energy, and speeds up the total execution time by
                1.32$\times$. By using NVMe-P2P that realizes peer-to-peer
                communication between Morpheus-SSD and a GPU, Morpheus-SSD can
                speed up the total execution time by 1.39$\times$ in a

               Units (GPUs), emerging data processing applications in GPU
               computing exhibit ten-fold speedups compared to CPU-only
               systems. However, this GPU-based acceleration is limited in many
               cases by the significant data movement overheads and inefficient
               memory management for host-side storage accesses. To address
               these shortcomings, this paper proposes a non-volatile memory
               management unit (NVMMU) that reduces the file data movement
               overheads by directly connecting the Solid State Disk (SSD) to
               the GPU. We implemented our proposed NVMMU on a real hardware
               with commercially available GPU and SSD devices by considering
               different types of storage interfaces and configurations. In
               this work, NVMMU unifies two discrete software stacks (one for
               the SSD and other for the GPU) in two major ways. While a new
               interface provided by our NVMMU directly forwards file data
               between the GPU runtime library and the I/O runtime library, it
               supports non-volatile direct memory access (NDMA) that pairs
               those GPU and SSD devices via physically shared system memory
               blocks. This unification in turn can eliminate unnecessary
               user/kernel-mode switching, improve memory management, and
               remove data copy overheads. Our evaluation results demonstrate
               that NVMMU can reduce the overheads of file data movement by
               95\% on average, improving overall system performance by 78\%

               the latest available high-bandwidth networks such as 10 Gigabit
               Ethernet. A key obstacle in achieving 10 gigabits per second is
               the high overhead of communication between the CPU and network
               interface controller (NIC), which typically resides on a
               standard I/O bus with high access latency. Using several
               network-intensive benchmarks, we investigate the impact of this
               overhead by analyzing the performance of hypothetical systems in
               which the NIC is more closely coupled to the CPU, including
               integration on the CPU die. We find that systems with
               high-latency NICs spend a significant amount of time in the
               device driver. NIC integration can substantially reduce this
               overhead, providing significant throughput benefits when other
               CPU processing is not a bottleneck. NIC integration also enables
               cache placement of DMA data. This feature has tremendous
               benefits when pay-loads are touched quickly, but potentially can
               harm performance in other situations due to cache pollution.",

               data to medical informatics that diagnose a disease from a given
               set of symptoms. Graph processing has several inherently
               parallel computation steps interspersed with synchronization
               needs. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are being proposed as a
               power-efficient choice for exploiting the inherent parallelism.
               There have been several efforts to efficiently map graph

               GPU while running the applications on both a cycle accurate

  abstract = "To address the growing I/O bottleneck, next-generation
              distributed I/O architectures employ scalable point-to-point
              interconnects and minimize operating system overhead by providing
              user-level access to the I/O subsystem. Reduced I/O overhead
              allows I/O intensive applications to efficiently employ latency
              hiding techniques for improved throughput. This paper presents
              the design of a novel scalable user-level I/O architecture and
              evaluates the impact of various architectural mechanisms in terms
              of overall performance improvement. Results demonstrate that
              eliminating data movement across protection domains is the
              dominant contributor to improved scalability. Eliminating system
              call and interrupt overhead only has a small additional benefit
              that may not justify the additional hardware support required.
              While this evaluation is based on one specific design, the
              conclusions can be generalized to other user-level I/O

               order of magnitude of DRAM, thereby motivating their inclusion
               on the memory bus. According to some recent work on NVM,
               traditional file systems are ineffective and sub-optimal in
               accessing data from this low latency media. However, there
               exists no systematic performance study across different file
               systems and their various configurations validating this point.
               In this work, we evaluate the performance of various legacy
               Linux file systems under various real world workloads on
               non-volatile memory (NVM) simulated using ramdisk and compare it
               against NVM optimized file system - PMFS. Our results show that
               while the default file system configurations are mostly
               sub-optimal for NVM, these legacy file systems can be tuned
               using mount and format options to achieve performance that is
               comparable to NVM-aware file system such as PMFS. Our
               experiments show that the performance difference between PMFS
               and ext2/ext3 with execute-in-place (XIP) option is around 5\%
               for many workloads (TPCC and YCSB). Furthermore, based on the
               learning from our performance study, we present few key file
               system features such as in-place update layout with XIP, and
               parallel metadata and data allocations, etc. that could be

               memory (PCM) promise to increase storage system performance by a
               wide margin relative to both conventional disks and flash-based
               SSDs. Realizing this potential will require significant changes
               to the way systems interact with storage devices as well as a
               rethinking of the storage devices themselves. This paper
               describes the architecture of a prototype PCIe-attached storage
               array built from emulated PCM storage called Moneta. Moneta
               provides a carefully designed hardware/software interface that
               makes issuing and completing accesses atomic. The atomic
               management interface, combined with hardware scheduling
               optimizations, and an optimized storage stack increases
               performance for small, random accesses by 18x and reduces
               software overheads by 60\%. Moneta array sustain 2.8 GB/s for
               sequential transfers and 541 K random 4 KB IO operations per
               second (8x higher than a state-of-the-art flash-based SSD).
               Moneta can perform a 5f 2-byte write in 9 us (5.6x faster than
               the SSD). Moneta provides a harmonic mean speedup of 2.1x and a
               maximum speed up of 9x across a range of file system, paging,
               and database workloads. We also explore trade-offs in Moneta's

               the data, the flash device itself. We argue that Active Flash
               has the potential to enable true out-of-core data analytics by
               freeing up both the compute core and the associated main memory.
               By performing analysis locally, dependence on limited bandwidth
               to a central storage system is reduced, while allowing this
               analysis to proceed in parallel with the main application. In
               addition, offloading work from the host to the more
               power-efficient controller reduces peak system power usage,
               which is already in the megawatt range and poses a major barrier
               to HPC system scalability. We propose an architecture for Active
               Flash, explore energy and performance trade-offs in moving
               computation from host to storage, demonstrate the ability of
               appropriate embedded controllers to perform data analysis and
               reduction tasks at speeds sufficient for this application, and
               present a simulation study of Active Flash scheduling policies.
               These results show the viability of the Active Flash model, and
               its capability to potentially have a transformative impact on
               scientific data analysis.",

  abstract = "Third-party accelerators offer system designers high performance
              and low energy without the market delay of in-house development.
              However, complex third-party accelerators may include
              vulnerabilities due to design flaws or malicious intent that are
              hard to expose during verification. Rather than react to each new
              vulnerability, it is better to proactively build defenses for
              classes of attacks. To inspire future work on defenses, this
              paper develops a taxonomy of accelerator vulnerabilities. We
              consider the cross product of threat types (confidentiality,
              integrity, and availability) with risk categories (configuration,
              computation, termination, accelerator memory accesses, system
              memory accesses, microarchitecture/coherence,
              exceptions/interrupts, and power), as well as whether processes
              can be vulnerable only if they use the offending accelerator
              (accelerator-scope threat) or even when running in the same
              system (system-scope threat). Our taxonomy draws attention to a

               research in accelerator analysis relies on RTL-based synthesis

               Such techniques not only require significant effort and

               modeling framework and demonstrate its application to
               system-on-chip (SoC) simulation. Aladdin estimates performance,

               scaling has stalled and thus power density is increasing each
               technology generation. Particularly in mobile devices, which
               have limited cooling options, these trends lead to a utilization
               wall in which sustained chip performance is limited primarily by
               power rather than area. However, many mobile applications do not
               demand sustained performance; rather they comprise short bursts
               of computation in response to sporadic user activity. To improve
               responsiveness for such applications, this paper explores
               activating otherwise powered-down cores for sub-second bursts of
               intense parallel computation. The approach exploits the concept
               of computational sprinting, in which a chip temporarily exceeds
               its sustainable thermal power budget to provide instantaneous
               throughput, after which the chip must return to nominal
               operation to cool down. To demonstrate the feasibility of this
               approach, we analyze the thermal and electrical characteristics
               of a smart-phone-like system that nominally operates a single
               core ( 1W peak), but can sprint with up to 16 cores for hundreds
               of milliseconds. We describe a thermal design that incorporates
               phase-change materials to provide thermal capacitance to enable
               such sprints. We analyze image recognition kernels to show that
               parallel sprinting has the potential to achieve the task
               response time of a 16W chip within the thermal constraints of a
               1W mobile platform.",

  abstract = "Near-threshold operation can increase the number of
              simultaneously active cores at the expense of much lower
              operating frequency (``dim silicon''), but dim cores suffer from
              diminishing returns as the number of cores increases. At this
              point, hardware accelerators become more efficient alternatives.
              To explore such a broad design space, the authors present an
              analytical model to quantify the performance limits of many-core,
              heterogeneous systems operating at near-threshold voltage. The
              model augments Amdahl's law with detailed scaling of frequency
              and power, calibrated by circuit-level simulations using a
              modified Predictive Technology Model (PTM), and factors in the
              effects of process variations. Results show that dim cores do
              indeed boost throughput, even in the presence of process
              variations, but significant benefits are achieved only in
              applications with high parallelism or novel architectures to
              mitigate variation. Reconfigurable logic that supports a variety
              of accelerators is more beneficial than ``dim cores'' or
              dedicated, fixed-logic accelerators, unless the kernel targeted
              by fixed logic has overwhelming coverage across applications, or
              the speedup of the dedicated accelerator over the reconfigurable
              equivalent is significant.",

               chain for building specialized, energy-saving coprocessors
               called Irregular Code Energy Reducers (ICERs) for a wide range
               of unmodified C programs. FPGAs are increasingly used to build
               large-scale systems, and many large software systems contain
               relatively little code that is amenable to automatic,
               semi-automatic, or even manual parallelization. Whereas
               accelerator approaches have traditionally achieved energy
               benefits as a side effect from increasing performance via
               parallel execution, ICERs aim to achieve energy gains even on
               code with little exploitable parallelism. Traditional approaches
               to automatically generating accelerators from existing software
               rely on inferring parallel execution from serial code, so they
               face the same code analysis challenges as parallelizing
               compilers. In contrast, because the ICER approach targets energy
               rather than performance, it easily scales to large, irregular
               applications that are poor candidates for traditional
               acceleration. Our results show that, compared to a baseline
               system with soft processor cores, ICERs can reduce energy
               consumption by up to 9.5x for the code they target and 2.8x for
               whole applications.",

              computing engines in recent years, fueled by high computational
              throughput and energy efficiency. There is heavier integration of
              the CPU and GPU, including the GPU appearing on the same die,
              further decreasing barriers to the use of the GPU to offload the
              CPU. Much effort has been made to adapt GPU designs to anticipate
              this new partitioning of the computation space, including better

               achieve the energy saving potential of the hybrid regulator

  abstract = "Because of the breakdown of Dennard scaling, the percentage of a
              silicon chip that can switch at full frequency drops
              exponentially with each process generation. This utilization wall
              forces designers to ensure that, at any point in time, large
              fractions of their chips are effectively ``dark silicon''--that
              is, significantly underclocked or idle for large periods of time.
              As exponentially larger fractions of a chip's transistors become
              dark, silicon area becomes an exponentially cheaper resource
              relative to power and energy consumption. This shift is driving a
              new class of architectural techniques that ``spend'' area to
              ``buy'' energy efficiency. All these techniques seek to introduce
              new forms of heterogeneity into the computational stack. This
              article begins by examining four promising directions--the ``four
              horsemen''--that have emerged as top contenders for thriving in
              the dark silicon age. Each direction carries with its virtues
              deep-seated restrictions that require a careful understanding of
              the underlying trade-offs and benefits. Furthermore, the author
              proposes a set of evolutionary dark silicon design principles and
              examines how one of the ``darkest'' computing architectures of

               exploit Moore's Law scaling, rather than focusing on single-core
               performance. The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift
               to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit
               multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been
               curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by
               combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore
               scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel
               workloads for the next five technology generations. For device
               scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more
               conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core
               scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to
               derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and
               power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build
               a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and
               lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include
               single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like
               multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric,
               dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that
               regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling
               is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the
               computing community. Even at 22 nm (just one year from now),
               21\% of a fixed-size chip must be powered off, and at 8 nm, this
               number grows to more than 50\%. Through 2024, only 7.9$\times$
               average speedup is possible across commonly used parallel
               workloads, leaving a nearly 24-fold gap from a target of doubled
               performance per generation.",

               interconnect architectures. It shows that the design choices for
               the interconnect have significant effect on the rest of the

               multicore architectures, equipped with specialized accelerators,
               is a challenging issue. Unlike regular CPUs that can
               transparently access the whole global memory address range,
               accelerators usually embed local memory on which they perform
               all their computations using a specific instruction set. While
               many research efforts have been devoted to offloading parts of a
               program over such coprocessors, the real challenge is to find a
               programming model providing a unified view of all available
               computing units. In this paper, we present an original runtime
               system providing a high-level, unified execution model allowing
               seamless execution of tasks over the underlying heterogeneous
               hardware. The runtime is based on a hierarchical memory
               management facility and on a codelet scheduler. We demonstrate
               the efficiency of our solution with a LU decomposition for both
               homogeneous (3.8 speedup on 4 cores) and heterogeneous machines
               (95 \% efficiency). We also show that a ``granularity aware''

               multiprocessor architectures that feature heterogeneous
               technologies such as specialized coprocessors (e.g. Cell/BE
               SPUs) or data-parallel accelerators (e.g. GPGPUs). Approaching
               the theoretical performance of these architectures is a complex
               issue. Indeed, substantial efforts have already been devoted to
               efficiently offload parts of the computations. However,
               designing an execution model that unifies all computing units
               and associated embedded memory remains a main challenge. We have
               thus designed StarPU, an original runtime system providing a
               high-level, unified execution model tightly coupled with an
               expressive data management library. The main goal of StarPU is
               to provide numerical kernel designers with a convenient way to
               generate parallel tasks over heterogeneous hardware on the one
               hand, and easily develop and tune powerful scheduling algorithms
               on the other hand. We have developed several strategies that can
               be selected seamlessly at run time, and we have demonstrated
               their efficiency by analyzing the impact of those scheduling
               policies on several classical linear algebra algorithms that
               take advantage of multiple cores and GPUs at the same time. In
               addition to substantial improvements regarding execution times,
               we obtained consistent superlinear parallelism by actually
               exploiting the heterogeneous nature of the machine.",

               compute specialization, however, the relative amount of time
               spent on memory or communication latency has increased. System
               and software optimizations for memory and communication often

  abstract = "Data movement (memory copies) is a very common operation during
              network processing and application execution on servers. The
              performance of this operation is rather poor on today's
              microprocessors due to the following aspects: 1) Several
              long-latency memory accesses are involved because the source
              and/or the destination are typically in memory, 2) latency hiding
              techniques, such as out-of-order execution, hardware threading,
              and prefetching, are not very effective for bulk data movement,
              and 3) microprocessors move data at register (small) granularity.
              In this paper, we show this overhead of bulk data movement and
              propose the use of dedicated copy engines to minimize it. We
              present a detailed analysis of copy engine architectures along
              two dimensions: 1) on-die versus off-die and 2) synchronous
              versus asynchronous. These copy engine architectures are superior
              to traditional direct memory access (DMA) engines because they
              are tightly coupled to the core architecture and enable lower
              overhead communication and signaling. We describe the hardware
              support required to implement these copy engines and integrate
              them into server platforms. We perform a detailed case study to
              evaluate the performance of these copy engines. The evaluation is
              based on an execution-driven simulator, which was extended with
              detailed models of copy engines. Our simulation results show that
              copy engines are effective in reducing the bulk data movement
              overhead and, hence, hold significant promise for
              high-performance server platforms",

abstract = {Hyperscale datacenter providers have struggled to balance the growing need for specialized hardware (efficiency) with the economic benefits of homogeneity (manageability).  In this paper we propose a new cloud architecture that uses reconfigurable logic to accelerate both network plane functions and applications.  This Configurable Cloud architecture places a layer of reconfigurable logic (FPGAs) between the network switches and the servers, enabling network flows to be programmably transformed at line rate, enabling acceleration of local applications running on the server, and enabling the FPGAs to communicate directly, at datacenter scale, to harvest remote FPGAs unused by their local servers.

We deployed this design over a production server bed, and show how it can be used for both service acceleration (Web search ranking) and network acceleration (encryption of data in transit at high-speeds).  This architecture is much more scalable than prior work which used secondary rack-scale networks for inter-FPGA communication.  By coupling to the network plane, direct FPGA-to-FPGA messages can be achieved at comparable latency to previous work, without the secondary network.  Additionally, the scale of direct inter-FPGA messaging is much larger.  The average round-trip latencies observed in our measurements among 24, 1000, and 250,000 machines are under 3, 9, and 20 microseconds, respectively.   The Configurable Cloud architecture has been deployed at hyperscale in Microsoft's production datacenters worldwide.},

abstract = {Datacenter workloads demand high computational capabilities, flexibility, power efficiency, and low cost. It is challenging to improve all of these factors simultaneously. To advance datacenter capabilities beyond what commodity server designs can provide, we have designed and built a composable, reconfigurable fabric to accelerate portions of large-scale software services. Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables. In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the large-scale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95% for a fixed latency distribution—or, while maintaining equivalent throughput, reduces the tail latency by 29%.},

  abstract  = "While emerging accelerator-centric architectures offer
               orders-of-magnitude performance and energy improvements, use
               cases and adoption can be limited by their rigid programming
               model. A unified virtual address space between the host CPU
               cores and customized accelerators can largely improve the
               programmability, which necessitates hardware support for address
               translation. However, supporting address translation for
               customized accelerators with low overhead is nontrivial. Prior
               studies either assume an infinite-sized TLB and zero page walk
               latency, or rely on a slow IOMMU for correctness and safety-
               which penalizes the overall system performance. To provide
               efficient address translation support for accelerator-centric
               architectures, we examine the memory access behavior of
               customized accelerators to drive the TLB augmentation and MMU
               designs. First, to support bulk transfers of consecutive data
               between the scratchpad memory of customized accelerators and the
               memory system, we present a relatively small private TLB design
               to provide low-latency caching of translations to each
               accelerator. Second, to compensate for the effects of the widely
               used data tiling techniques, we design a shared level-two TLB to
               serve private TLB misses on common virtual pages, eliminating
               duplicate page walks from accelerators working on neighboring
               data tiles that are mapped to the same physical page. This
               two-level TLB design effectively reduces page walks by 75.8\% on
               average. Finally, instead of implementing a dedicated MMU which
               introduces additional hardware complexity, we propose simply
               leveraging the host per-core MMU for efficient page walk
               handling. This mechanism is based on our insight that the
               existing MMU cache in the CPU MMU satisfies the demand of
               customized accelerators with minimal overhead. Our evaluation
               demonstrates that the combined approach incurs only a 6.4\%
               performance overhead compared to the ideal address translation.",

               accelerators like GPUs being tightly integrated with CPUs on the
               same die. Extending the CPU's virtual addressing mechanism to
               these accelerators is a key step in making accelerators easily
               programmable. In this work, we analyze, using real-system
               measurements, shared virtual memory across the CPU and an
               integrated GPU. We make several key observations and highlight
               consequent research opportunities: (1) servicing a TLB miss from
               the GPU can be an order of magnitude slower than that from the
               CPU and consequently it is imperative to enable many concurrent
               TLB misses to hide this larger latency; (2) divergence in memory
               accesses impacts the GPU's address translation more than the
               rest of the memory hierarchy, and research in designing address
               translation mechanisms tolerant to this effect is imperative;
               and (3) page faults from the GPU are considerably slower than
               that from the CPU and software-hardware co-design is essential
               for efficient implementation of page faults from
               throughput-oriented accelerators like GPUs. We present a
               detailed measurement study of a commercially available
