# Hardware
Quadro 6000 (why old GPU? Compare with GPUvm; the only one works with
Gdev, GPUvm, Clover, ...; wlog)

Clover does not work with Quadro P6000. We may use 750Ti (???) if we
need a modern GPU.

GPUvm is supposed to have ~100x overheads, and TGSI should have 2-10x.
So it is fair to have kernels run for 200 ms on native devices.

Instead of using "Init, MemAlloc, HtoD, Exec, DtoH, Close" as metrics,
we care more about "Init, HtoD, Exec, DtoH" in our case.

SetKernelArg time needs to be removed from kernel execution time in some
benchmarks.

RPC data copy time needs to be factored out in final analysis. So we
need to measure this part of time separately.

It will be good to use the same data size on GPUvm. Gdev has some
restrictions for data size.

Data size and iteration times need to be confirmed.

# backprop
Run the kernel once
Data size = 4194304 ==> 524288
Local workgroup size = 128

# bfs
Run the kernel once
Use data file graph65536.txt

# gaussian
Run kernel once
Matrix size = 2048 ==> 1024

# hotspot
Iterations = 10,000 ==> 500
Layer size = 1024x4 ==> 512x2

# lud
Run kernel once
Matrix size = 8192 ==> 2048

# nn
Run kernel 10,000 times ==> 1,000

# pathfinder
Run 100,000 iterations ==> 102,400

# srad
Run 2,500 iterations ==> 200
