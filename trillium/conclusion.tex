\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_con}

% Virtualizing GPGPUs is a balancing act: there is no clear winner; only a set
% of design points each offering a different trade-off of key virtualization
% properties. The \vframework framework enables clear reasoning about these trade-offs.
\Trillium represents a local optima in the GPGPU virtualization space---by decoupling device
virtualization from GPU ISA virtualization, it maintains the virtualization benefits of
a para-virtual system, while exhibiting the performance of a user-space remoting system.
